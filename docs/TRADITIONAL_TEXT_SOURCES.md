# Traditional Source Map - Panchang Core

## Purpose

This document is a source-integrity map for the package.

It is **not** a manuscript-critical proof document, and it does **not** claim that every package rule is directly established from a single Sanskrit passage. The codebase mixes:

- **Direct Panchang/Jyotisha conventions** that are widely standard
- **Package rule mappings** attributed to traditional muhurta literature
- **Regional or published almanac conventions**
- **Modern secondary references**
- **A few helpers that are explicitly heuristic or legacy**

To keep this document stable, it uses **file/function-level references** instead of fragile line-number tables.

This document covers **traditional source attributions**.  
Some package components are architectural helpers and are intentionally **not** tied to traditional texts:
- `OutputGeneratorService` (output assembly wrapper around package services)
- `CliBootstrap` (standalone bootstrap helper for env/config/container wiring)

Currently, the package implements **237** top-level festival definitions within `FestivalService::FESTIVALS`. Each entry maps to a specific timing rule (Tithi, Nakshatra, Yoga, etc.) with associated metadata.
- Localization: user-facing outputs support `en`, `hi`, `gu`.
- Calendar conventions: both `amanta` and `purnimanta` are supported.

## Confidence Tiers

### Tier 1: Direct or Standard Panchang Conventions

These are standard astronomical or calendrical conventions that are broadly stable across traditional Panchang computation.

| File | Functions/Constants | Source Attribution |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `ClassicalTimeConstants.php` | `GHATIKA_IN_MINUTES = 24`<br>`PALA_IN_SECONDS = 24`<br>`MUHURTA_IN_MINUTES = 48`<br>`DEGREES_PER_NAKSHATRA = 360/27`<br>`DEGREES_PER_TITHI = 12` | **Traditional convention:** Sūrya Siddhānta-style astronomy and long-standing almanac convention |
| `Tithi.php` | `fromLongitudes()`<br>`getFractionRemaining()` | **Traditional convention:** 30 lunar days, each 12° Moon-Sun separation (Sūrya Siddhānta 1.29) |
| `Nakshatra.php` | `fromLongitude()`<br>`getPada()` | **Traditional convention:** 27 nakṣatras, each 13°20' (Sūrya Siddhānta 8.1) |
| `Yoga.php` | `fromLongitudes()` | **Traditional convention:** 27 yogas, each 13°20' Sun-Moon sum (Sūrya Siddhānta 3.1-3) |
| `Karana.php` | `fromTithi()` | **Traditional convention:** 11 karanas, each 6° Moon-Sun separation (Muhūrta Chintāmaṇi Chapter 2) |

---

### Tier 2: Package Rule Mappings Attributed to Traditional Muhurta Literature

These parts of the package are **rulebooks encoded by the package**. They may be inspired by or attributed to texts such as Muhūrta Chintāmaṇi, Bṛhat Saṃhitā, Muhūrta Mārtaṇḍa, Māyamata, Vaikhānasa Āgama, Aśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, and related traditions.

They should be read as **package mappings**, not as proof that every table entry has been independently verified against a primary-edition Sanskrit text.

| File | Functions/Constants | Source Attribution |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `ElectionalRuleBook.php` | `UNIVERSAL_BAD_TITHIS`<br>`VARA_TITHI_YOGAS` | **Package attribution:** Muhurta Chintamani, Brihat Samhita, Mayamata, Vaikhanasa Agama, Ashvalayana Grihya Sutra |
| `ElectionalEvaluator.php` | `calculatePanchakaDosha()`<br>`calculateDagdhaTithi()`<br>`calculateDagdhaYoga()`<br>`calculateRiktaTithi()`<br>`calculateAbhijitCancellation()`<br>`generateRejectionReport()` | **Package attribution:** Muhurta Chintamani, Brihat Samhita, Gargiya Jyotisha |
| `PanchangService.php` | `getElectionalSnapshot()`<br>`getDailyMuhurtaEvaluation()` | **Package attribution:** Muhurta Chintamani, Muhurta Martanda |

### Tier 3: Festival-Resolution Logic with Traditional Basis

These components implement festival and observance resolution where the package draws on traditional kala-nirṇaya style reasoning and fast/observance practice.

| File | Functions | Source Attribution |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| `FestivalService.php` | `resolveFestivalsForDate()`<br>`buildFestivalPayload()`<br>`FestivalService::FESTIVALS` catalog metadata | **Package convention:** date-wise festival resolution with localized display fields and machine-stable calculation-basis metadata |
| `PanchangService.php` | `getFestivalYearCalendar()` | **Package convention:** location-aware year aggregation, `day_after` festival orchestration, and adjacent duplicate consolidation |
| `KalaNirnayaEngine.php` | Festival `karmakala_type` handling:<br>- `madhyahna`<br>- `nishitha`<br>- `pradosha`<br>- `aparahna`<br>- `sunrise`<br>Vaishnava Ekadashi handling | **Traditional convention:** Nirṇaya Sindhu, Muhūrta Chintāmaṇi, Hari Bhakti Vilāsa |
| `BhadraEngine.php` | Bhadra/Vishti subdivision helpers | **Package attribution:** Muhūrta Chintāmaṇi, Nirṇaya Sindhu, Ernst Wilhelm's Classical Muhurta |
| `PanchangService.php` | Timed Bhadra windows<br>Timed Varjyam windows<br>Timed Amrita Kaal windows<br>Timed Pradosha window<br>Daily Karmakala output assembly<br>Sunrise/current Panchanga state separation | **Published Panchang convention:** JME native ephemeris-based live calculation |
| `SpecialYogaCalculator.php` | `calculateSpecialYogas()`<br>Structured outputs for:<br>- Sarvartha Siddhi<br>- Amrit Siddhi<br>- Ravi Yoga<br>- Ravi Pushya<br>- Guru Pushya<br>- Dwipushkar<br>- Tripushkar<br>- Ganda Mula<br>- Vinchhudo<br>- Aadal<br>- Vidaal<br>- Jwalamukhi | **Package attribution:** Muhurta Chintamani, Muhurta Martanda, and regional/published Panchang tables. These are encoded as package rule mappings, not source-critical primary-text proofs for every table cell. |
| `SpecialYogaCalculator.php` | `calculateAnandadiYoga()` | **Package attribution:** Sripati/Jyotisha Ratnamala 28-nakshatra tradition, including the package's Abhijit-inclusive counting model (`rule_system = sripati_jyotisha_ratnamala_28_nakshatra`) |
| `SpecialYogaCalculator.php` | `calculateAmritadiYoga()` | **Package attribution:** Classical Amritadi weekday-nakshatra table as used in published Panchang literature (`rule_system = amritadi_yoga_27_nakshatra_7_weekday`) |
| `SpecialYogaCalculator.php` | `calculateMaitreyaYoga()` | **Package attribution:** Published muhurta/panchang combinational rule for debt-repayment muhurta using weekday + nakshatra + lagna overlap (`rule_system = weekday_nakshatra_lagna_debt_repayment`) |
| `SpecialYogaCalculator.php` | `calculateGajachchhayaYoga()` | **Package attribution:** Muhurta/Panchang tradition for Gajachchhaya variants using Tithi + Sun-nakshatra + Moon-nakshatra conditions; implemented as a package-known variant set, not as a claim of one single universal classical formula |
| `PanchakCalculator.php` | `calculatePanchak()` | **Published Panchang convention:** Moon in Dhanishtha pada 3 through Revati (`rule_system = moon_dhanishta_pada_3_to_revati`) |
| `ShoolaCalculator.php` | `calculateDishaShool()` | **Published Panchang convention:** common weekday-direction travel table used in general muhurta/almanac practice |
| `ShoolaCalculator.php` | `calculateNakshatraShool()` | **Published Panchang convention:** travel-direction table keyed by nakshatra (`source_family = popular_travel_muhurta_panchang_table`) |
| `VaasaCalculator.php` | `calculateRahuVaasa()`<br>`calculateChandraVaasa()`<br>`calculateShivaVaasa()`<br>`calculateAgniVaasa()`<br>`calculateYoginiVaasa()` | **Package attribution:** Muhurta Chintamani plus published Panchang/Nivas-Shool style tables. `Chandra_Vaasa` is exposed as Moon-rashi directional residence (`rule_system = moon_rashi_direction_4_direction`) and preserves the older nakshatra-pada abode windows under `nakshatra_pada_vaasa`. Shiva/Agni/Yogini/Rahu Vaasa are package rule mappings derived from almanac-style tables rather than manuscript-critical primary-text extraction. |
| `EkadashiParanaCalculator.php` | `buildEkadashiObservance()`<br>`buildParanaPayload()` | **Traditional convention:** Nirṇaya Sindhu / Hari Bhakti Vilāsa style Ekadashi-parana handling via the package's Kala Nirnaya workflow |

---

### Tier 4: Published Panchang and Regional-Practice Conventions

These features are useful and intentionally included, but they are best described as **published Panchang conventions** or **regional almanac systems**, not universally fixed classical formulas.

| File | Functions | Source Attribution |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| `MuhurtaService.php` | `calculateHora()`<br>`calculateHoraTable()`<br>`calculateChogadiya()`<br>`calculateChogadiyaTable()`<br>`calculateBadTimes()`<br>`calculateDaylightFivefoldDivision()`<br>`calculateNishitaMuhurta()`<br>`calculateVijayaMuhurta()`<br>`calculateGodhuliMuhurta()`<br>`calculateSandhya()`<br>`calculateGowriPanchangam()`<br>`calculateKalaVela()`<br>`calculatePrahara()`<br>`calculateBrahmaMuhurta()`<br>`calculateDurMuhurta()`<br>`calculateVarjyam()`<br>`calculateAmritaKaal()`<br>`calculateNakshatraPeriodWindows()`<br>`calculatePradoshaKaal()`<br>`calculateLagnaTable()` | **Published Panchang convention:** Varies by tradition and regional practice |
| `MuhurtaService.php` + extracted calculators | Daily output blocks:<br>- `Hora`<br>- `Chogadiya`<br>- `Hora_Full_Day`<br>- `Chogadiya_Full_Day`<br>- `Muhurta_Full_Day`<br>- `Rahu_Kaal_Gulika_Yamaganda`<br>- `Abhijit_Muhurta`<br>- `Prahara_Full_Day`<br>- `Daylight_Fivefold_Division`<br>- `Brahma_Muhurta`<br>- `Dur_Muhurta_Full_Day`<br>- `Nishita_Muhurta`<br>- `Vijaya_Muhurta`<br>- `Godhuli_Muhurta`<br>- `Sandhya`<br>- `Gowri_Panchangam`<br>- `Kala_Vela`<br>- `Karmakala_Windows`<br>- `Varjyam`<br>- `Amrita_Kaal`<br>- `Pradosha_Kaal`<br>- `Lagna_Full_Day` | **Published Panchang convention:** Implementation follows published almanac patterns across `DailyPeriodsCalculator`, `InauspiciousPeriodsCalculator`, `HoraCalculator`, `ChogadiyaCalculator`, `GowriPanchangamCalculator`, and `LagnaTableCalculator` |

**Notes:**
- `Gowri_Panchangam` is implemented as a Gowri-style 8-part day/night table based on the package's chosen published-table convention (Tamil Gowri/Pambu Panchangam)
- `Kala_Vela` is based on a secondary-source rule pattern attributed to Saravali-style descriptions, not a source-critical Sanskrit edition
- `Godhuli_Muhurta` and `Sandhya` are tradition-sensitive and may vary by school
- `Brahma Muhurta` uses the published Panchang dynamic night-muhurta convention by default: previous sunset to sunrise divided into 15 night muhurtas, with Brahma Muhurta as the penultimate pre-sunrise night muhurta. The fixed 48-minute convention is still exposed as a named nested convention.
- `Varjyam`, `Amrita_Kaal`, and `Pradosha_Kaal` in `PanchangService` are live-timed Panchang-day outputs and should be preferred over legacy scalar helpers when available. `Amrita_Kaal` is calculated from nakshatra-specific Amrita ghati offsets and is not derived from Varjyam.
- `Lagna_Full_Day` is a calculated ascendant-sign timing table for the day; it includes partial intervals that overlap the sunrise-to-next-sunrise Panchang day and is not a natal/person-specific reading
- Top-level `Tithi` and `Karana` retain sunrise semantics for backwards compatibility. Runtime values are exposed explicitly as `Current_Tithi_At_Input_Now` and `Current_Karana_At_Input_Now`.
- Festival output metadata intentionally separates canonical rule values from localized companion labels. For example, `calculation_basis.month.value` remains the machine-stable Sanskrit month key for the configured calendar type, while `calculation_basis.month.name` is localized for the active locale
- Special-yoga and vaasa outputs are package rule mappings used for general panchang and muhurta screening. They are not natal/person-specific interpretations
- Month calendar moonrise/moonset output is date-qualified because a lunar visibility interval can begin on one civil date and end after midnight on the next civil date

### Tier 5: Explicitly Legacy or Heuristic Helpers

These are present in the codebase but are **not** represented as fully verified primary-source logic.

| File | Functions | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| `ElectionalEvaluator.php` | `calculateTransitMoorthy()` | **Legacy heuristic:** Unverified moorthy classifier |
| `ElectionalEvaluator.php` | `calculateBhadra()` legacy moon-sign heuristic | **Legacy heuristic:** Prefer live-timed alternative in PanchangService |
| `ElectionalEvaluator.php` | `calculateAmritaKaal()` legacy Choghadiya-based helper | **Legacy heuristic:** Prefer authoritative Amrita calculation |
| `ElectionalEvaluator.php` | `calculateVarjyam()` legacy Visha Ghati helper | **Legacy heuristic:** Prefer KP System-based calculation |

**Where the package has a more authoritative live-timed alternative, that alternative should be preferred over these helpers.**

---

## Non-Text Architectural Helpers (Out of Scope for Source Attribution)

These components are implementation utilities and should not be interpreted as traditional-rule sources:

| File | Functions | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| `OutputGeneratorService.php` | `generateFestivals()`<br>`generateEclipses()`<br>`generateTodayPanchang()`<br>`generateAll()` | Output composition layer around `PanchangService` / `EclipseService` |
| `CliBootstrap.php` | `init()`<br>`makePanchangService()`<br>`makeEclipseService()`<br>`makeOutputGenerator()` | Standalone bootstrapping utility for scripts |

## Recommended Interpretation for Maintainers

When adding or modifying source attributions in code, use these prefixes:

| Prefix | When to Use | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `Traditional convention:` | Stable Panchang arithmetic or long-standing calendrical units | `Traditional convention: Sūrya Siddhānta 1.29` |
| `Package attribution:` | Package encodes a rulebook or mapping from traditional literature | `Package attribution: Muhurta Chintamani Chapter 4` |
| `Published Panchang convention:` | Daily-window systems where practice varies by region | `Published Panchang convention: Tamil Gowri table` |
| `Legacy` or `heuristic` | Helper is not the preferred authoritative path | `Legacy heuristic: prefer live-timed alternative` |
